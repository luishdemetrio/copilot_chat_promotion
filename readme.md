### Script-based Teams Nudge App
[This document](https://github.com/luishdemetrio/copilot_chat_promotion/blob/main/instructions/PowerShell%20Promoting%20Copilot%20Chat%20on%20Teams.pdf) provides guidance on deploying a PowerShell script that sends Adaptive Card messages to users in Microsoft Teams. The script uses the Microsoft Graph API for 
communication, and it employs parallel processing to work efficiently while reducing file input and output operations. 

The Adaptive Card, which is central to the script, contains six buttons. Each button corresponds to a specific prompt. When a user clicks on a button, the card triggers an action that opens a new browser tab. The chosen prompt is automatically copied into a dialog box in the browser. 

The user can then review the prompt, make edits to modify it if needed, and click a "Send" button to execute the prompt. This interactive design allows users flexibility to tailor the prompt before sending.
